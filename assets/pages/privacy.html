        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
            Hai~ This is a non-serious privacy policy since I don't have any serious projects that really requires a professional draft.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just know that I'm not doing anything bad with your data. I kinda just collect access logs so I know I'm not being hacked.
            This includes your IP address and when & where you accessed my stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't fret. I don't store any of this data in a permanent log. They are kept in the console and will disappear when the server shutsdown.
        </p>
        <p>
            But if you are really concerned with your data, just contact me, we can figure it out together. I don't bite, trust me. .w.

            Uhhh... If you're planning on suing me, please don't. I'm just a naive kolleg student. ;-;
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have any issues, just contact me. They should be down below in the footer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thanks! &lt;3 .w.
