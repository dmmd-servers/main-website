From speaking up and making my first friends to having faith in myself and the people around me and even inspiring me to continue taking risks and challenges in life, Undertale was literally always there in each step of my life. It was the key for me to stay motivated throughout my first few months in middle/high school, a time when I was one of the shyest students in the classroom, and I hope the lessons will persist with me throughout my entire life. It would not be an exaggeration to say that without Undertale, I would not be the same me today.",
