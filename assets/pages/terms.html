        <h2>Some Basic Ground Rules</h2>
        <p>
            Hai, this is a non-serious terms of service since I don't have anything that requires a professional draft right now.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use some common sense when using my services or interacting with my APIs.
            That means don't try to do illegal stuff with it, don't try to hurt or harm people with it, and don't try to hack or destroy my stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
            All logos, assets, programs, and other intellectual property created or belonging to me are protected under the MIT license unless otherwise stated.
            I'm pretty lenient with copyrights. As long as you don't pretend to be me and do bad things with it, you're free to do whatever.
            Still, I encourage you to talk to me first if you are gonna use it for commercial purposes / public use.
        </p>
        <p>
            You automatically agree to these terms by visiting my website and using my services.

        <h2>Changes to Terms of Service</h2>
        <p>
            I don't have a subscription set up. There is no way for me to announce to you that I have changed the Terms of Service.
            Just check frequently. Sorry.

        <h2>Legal Stuff</h2>
        <p>
            Uhhh... If you're planning on suing me, please don't. I'm just a naive kolleg student. ;-;
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have any issues, just contact me. They should be down below in the footer.
